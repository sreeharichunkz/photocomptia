       <!--     <h3>15. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BILLING</h3>
                We offer the facility to sign up to a number of subscription plans, including plans with differing tiers, conditions, limitations and features or for you to enter into individual photo challenges on payment of a fee. You can sign up to such plans or find specific details regarding your subscription or our pricing on our website. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered pricing and subscription plans from time to time. You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel your subscription plan using your online account on the website. If you are signing up to a subscription plan or paying a fee you must provide us with or use a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be advised by us from time to time ("Payment Method"). We will bill the subscription or any other fee, and any applicable taxes such as value added tax, to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each subscription period in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment Method. Where you change your plan during a subscription period, we may bill you any difference between the subscription fee for your old and new plans for the remainder of that period. The amount billed for the subscribed plan is a recurring amount which will only be varied in the event that you change your plan or we adjust the prices. Where the applicable subscription fee is varied, you authorise us to charge your Payment Method for such varied amounts. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Service in our sole discretion. Any price changes will take effect no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. Subject to an initial 14-day cooling off period within which you will receive a full refund in the event of cancellation (except when rating has already commenced in respect of a photo challenge that you have entered), all payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.

                13. FINAL POINTS
                No person who is not a party to these Terms may enforce them and any legislation according rights to third parties shall not apply. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Photocomptia in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for in these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of that right or any further rights. Photocomptia shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations in these Terms where such failure results from any cause beyond Photocomptia’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Photocomptia may transfer or assign these Terms and its rights and obligations under them without consent but you may only transfer or assign the same with our prior written consent. The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and settle any disputes. Both parties agree that these Terms represent the full mutual understanding of the parties and supersede all and any previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided above. Any notice under these Terms may be sent electronically to the email address notified by each party to the other and will be deemed to have been received on the expiration of 48 hours after service.
